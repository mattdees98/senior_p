        Cultural Capital is a concept associated with the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu.  Put most succinctly, it refers to the concrete social habits that embody cultural mastery, and that can be picked up or dropped depending on a person’s desire to identify (or not) within a given group.  From holding up a pinkie while drinking one’s tea to knowing how to do the wave at a sports game to one motorcycle rider discreetly waving with the left hand to another coming in the opposite direction, the habits of culture are how we learn to identify ourselves and belong to larger groups.  Who exactly taught us to smile for the camera and stand in front of the monument?  But people acquainted with the social habits of the West do it no almost matter who they are, and how well- (or ill-) represented they may feel about the place in question.
